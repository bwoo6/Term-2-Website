			<p>When I was young I lived in the Phillippines, I always played the other nba 2k games with my friends. I really loved NBA 2k, it is my childhood memory even though I still play it. It is a time killing game and it's really fun to play. I get to play lots of players like my favorite NBA player Stephen Curry, NBA 2k is a fun game because my hobby is playing basketball so NBA 2k actually makes me feel good.</p>
